geckoboard-java-api
==============

This will be a geckoboard java api. 

Before it is a geckoboard api, here's the list of things to do: 
1. Write tests
2. Switch from jackson to gson, using object trees instead of pushing stuff 
3. So it is possible to integrate the highchart java api (https://github.com/one2team/highcharts-serverside-export)
4. Build the maps api
